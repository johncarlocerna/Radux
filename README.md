# Radux
Radux is a lightweight, interactive webapp that grabs news articles in real time via RSS feeds and displays them based on location on a global map. News articles are taken from news outlets such as the Washington Post, CNN, and the Guardian, and organized into specific cities/regions. Users are then able to read the latest news in locations that they care about, while also being able to interact with a globe from Google Earth.  

Radux was created as a submission for the Broward College Hackathon. It was written in HTML and relied on RSSInclude to harvest the data and Google Earth to create the globe used in our user interface.

*As of November 12th, 2016, my RSSInclude account has expired. This means that the RSS feed no longer updates with news, as a premium account was considered too costly for extended use. I apologize for the inconvenience.
